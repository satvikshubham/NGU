# Newton Raphson Method
The code solves the non-linear system of equations with multi-variables using the Newton Raphson method.

### To-do list:
1. Work on symbolic algebra
2. Work on initial guesses
3. Fix Jacobian matrix sparsity
4. Diagonal dominance
5. Convergence criteria
6. Matrix charactertics and use differnet methods

### Micellaneous:
The solve function stops on slightly complex equations
- I think the problem here is incorrect parsing of the symbols like sin, cos, tan, etc.
